# ManufacturingAPI

## Run Instructions
Ensure the db.env, cacert.pem, and app.py files are all within the same folder.  The Flask API can be started by running the app.py file.  This will launch it on a localhost server (URI placed in the terminal after successful start), where it can then be tested with postman desktop client.

db.env contains the connection credentials required for the PlanetScale SQL database, where all the part numbers and inventories are kept.
